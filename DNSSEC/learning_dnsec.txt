1st day

DNS caching is aggressive.

It remembers for some time.

Some fucking issue with my brew

Who runs root server ? A-K root servers
Who decides root server?

Zone and domains?

DNS works on UDP, latency

13 root servers - Limited  to packet size limitation

Clearing dns cache?
TTL is decided on dns  - Who hosts it decide, recursive server
No entries in /etc/resolv.conf

How much times does it caches? Does it over write?

Different types of DNS records - A , AAAA, MX

SRV record can be used for load balancing
SOA for authorative servers

EDNS0

DNS recon

in-addr.arpa
